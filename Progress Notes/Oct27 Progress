Here's what i have
    Generates a fasta file containing all the species names, vouchers*, and sequences of every entry in a column of
        a specified gene
    It only works with one column per one sheet per run
    I want to finish the genscrape_function Tester before implementing it into the actual file
Here's what i need to do
    Update the code so that it can take parameter-specified information
    Put the tester code into the genscrape function
    Figure out if stormie needs me to basically do this for every single sheet (NEED every sheet in same file)
    Address the seemingly funny entries like MF274967.1 'uncultured bacterium clone'
    Figure out what to do about the ones with no voucher numbers
    We have sequence data, remember what i was blasting in the first place?
    Figure out how to get the vouchers for entries that dont have voucher numbers in the genbank title
    What sheets do i need to worry about
        HBGPredata, carid master,
    9 fasta files, one for each gene
    indicate which ones where missing/not
